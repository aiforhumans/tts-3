"""Utility wrapper for integrating OpenVoice TTS models.

This module currently contains only a stub implementation. The
``synthesize_openvoice`` function below simply writes a silent audio file and
does **not** run any real OpenVoice inference.

To enable actual OpenVoice synthesis you will need to download the official
models and place them under ``models/OpenVoice``. Once the models are present
you can replace the stub code with calls to the real inference pipeline (for
example using ``fairseq`` or the OpenVoice API).

    Parameters
    ----------
    text: str
        Text to synthesize.
    speaker_wav_path: str
        Path to a reference speaker WAV file.
    output_wav_path: str
        Destination path for the generated audio.

    -------
    str
        Path to the resulting WAV file.

    Notes
    -----
    This stub simply writes three seconds of silence to demonstrate how the
    function is expected to behave. Replace this implementation with actual
    model loading and inference once the OpenVoice checkpoints are available in
    ``OPENVOICE_MODEL_PATH``.
